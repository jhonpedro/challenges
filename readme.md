### Challenges

All the challanges that i made are in here.
The name of each file in Challenges/ is very descritive, so, if you want to see any resolution you can find by it's name.


### Data Structures

I am implementing some data structures in Javascript and Python to see how each language manage the environment around that especific data structre. But mainly its for understand and develop the data structures itself. I've already studied this in Estrutura de Dados wich was presented to me in the second period of college but i really liked this class and now i'm here.



ps: i use nodemon here to just dont need to type node ... every time i want to see de result. Aparently (I didnt tested) nodemon works for python too
